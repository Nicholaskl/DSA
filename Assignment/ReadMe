Purpose: A DSA Assignemnt for sem 2 2019 that is a simulation for a socical network with users and posts, exploring how information propagates through a social Network
         and seeing the effects that the posters followers has on the propagation of the information.

How to Run: "java SocialSim -i" for interactive mode which has the features of the program
            "java SocialSim -s <NetworkFileName> <EventFileName> <ProbabilityForLike> <ProbabilityForFollow>"

Files in project: DSAGraph.java, DSALinkedList.java, DSAQueue.java, DSAStack.java, FollowNetwork.java, interactiveMode.java, SimulationMode.java, SocialSim.java

Test Files: GraphTestHarness.java, LinkedListTestHarness.java, QueueTestHarness.java, StackTestHarness.java
            other test files include prac6_2.al which is a file read in GraphTestHarness that is from Prac05 accessed on Monday, 30th September 2019
            test1EF, test1NW, test2NW, test3NW and test4NW are test files to be read by simulation mode. These files were used in the report

Other files: InvestigationReport.pdf and ProgramDocuments.pdf are the two files with the report and other program documentation
             DeclarationOfOriginality_v1.1.pdf is the signed pdf for the assigment

TODO: None

Known bugs
	bug#_<number>: <what bug is it (faults in the program)>
    How to replicate: <How can someone else cause the same bug, you may reference the failed test case is applicable or just provide instructions>
    [suspected] cause: <what is the cause (or what do you think is the cause). This is optional and omitted if you have not started isolating the issue.>
    how to fix: <how you think the bug could be fixed>

    Additional functionality: <Things that the program can do that is outside of the scope. i.e.: the bells and whistles>
